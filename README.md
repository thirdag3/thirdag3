### Hello there, I'm Bruno 👋

I love building interesting, technical projects and learning more about software development and tech in general. Writing clean and elegant code is something I always aim for. Having been exposed to computers from very early on in my life, I have always been connected to and identified with the digital world.

### ⚗️ Main interests

- 🛠️ Software Engineering
- 💻 Operating Systems
- 🔐 Cybersecurity
 
🔍 Currently learning more about Rust but always working on all kinds of projects, most of which are hosted here on GitHub.

### 🔮 Languages and Tools
